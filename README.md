# Long time no commit?

## Introduction

Hey. I'm hmahmood2351/mhm271 (more known by the latter than the former). Based in London, the UK.

Interested in technology as a whole. In particular and currently, concerning the fields of **Networking**, **Automation**, and the **Cloud**. However I can say that I do retain an interest for Sysadmin work, Linux, Security, Wireless, and Design (might as well list the whole protocol stack while I'm at it, right?).

Currently studying for: the CCNP, and playing around with the Azure platform and automation tools in my spare time.

Not working completely in IT (yet!). Looking to break into the industry.

This GitHub aims to be a public display of my research and things that I do whilst looking into the three topics listed above. However, if I do come across any ideas that pique my interest relating to areas such as Security or Design. I'll be sure to post it here, too. 

Looking to work with others on any interesting/cool projects. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions at all.
